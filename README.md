# Blind-Spot-Monitoring-System
Blind spot is the region of the vehicle that is not visible to the driver via side or rear mirrors. It is caused by obstruction from other vehicles, objects, or pedestrians, and can lead to accidents and injuries. My proposed model will be able to identify objects in the blind spot area using an Arduino and ultrasonic sensor.
